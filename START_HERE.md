# üöÄ START HERE - RideGrid Setup

## Welcome! This is your entry point.

### ‚ö° TL;DR - Get Running Now

```bash
# From the project root
./scripts/setup.sh
```

That's it! The script will:
- ‚úÖ Auto-detect what you have (Docker, Python, Node.js)
- ‚úÖ Choose the best deployment mode
- ‚úÖ Set everything up automatically
- ‚úÖ Tell you exactly what to do next

---

## üéØ What Mode Will You Get?

### If You Have Docker ‚úÖ
**‚Üí Docker Mode (Recommended)**
- Everything runs in containers
- Zero local dependencies needed
- Production-like environment
- Just run `./scripts/setup.sh`

### If You DON'T Have Docker ‚ùå
**‚Üí Local Mode**
- Requires Python 3.11+ and Node.js 20+
- Services run on your machine
- Good for development
- Just run `./scripts/setup.sh`

**The script adapts automatically!**

---

## üìã What You Need

### Minimum (one of these):
- **Option A**: Docker Desktop
- **Option B**: Python 3.11+ AND Node.js 20+

### That's it! 
No PostgreSQL, Redis, or Kafka installation required - they run in Docker if available, or the system adapts.

---

## üèÉ Quick Start Steps

### 1. Run Setup
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### 2. Follow the Output
The script will tell you exactly what to do next based on your system.

### 3. Access the App
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API**: http://localhost:8001  
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3001 (admin/admin)

**Q: What if I have nothing?**  
A: The script will tell you exactly what to install.

**Q: How do I stop everything?**  
A: Run `./scripts/stop-all.sh` or `cd deploy/docker-compose && docker-compose down`

**Q: Something broke, what now?**  
A: Check [DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md](DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md) troubleshooting section.

## üÜò Quick Troubleshooting

### Setup script fails
```bash
# Check what you have
docker --version
python3 --version
node --version

# If missing, install:
# Docker: https://docker.com
# Python: https://python.org
# Node: https://nodejs.org
```

### Port conflicts
```bash
# Kill processes on busy ports
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:8001 | xargs kill -9
```

### Services won't start
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f logs/*.log

# Or if using Docker
cd deploy/docker-compose
docker-compose logs -f
```
