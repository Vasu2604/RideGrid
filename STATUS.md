## ⚠️ What's NOT Running (Yet)

The backend services need infrastructure that requires Docker:
- ❌ Gateway API (needs PostgreSQL)
- ❌ Database (PostgreSQL)
- ❌ Redis cache
- ❌ Kafka messaging
- ❌ Grafana dashboards

**Why?** You don't have Docker installed yet.

## 🚀 To Get Everything Working

**The full system needs Docker. Here's why:**

Docker provides:
- PostgreSQL database (with PostGIS for geo queries)
- Redis cache (for driver locations)
- Kafka (for event streaming)
- Prometheus (for metrics)
- Grafana (for dashboards)

**All in ONE command after Docker is installed!**
